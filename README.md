# AI Crash Course

Sample programs that help illustrate what is possible with AI. This is *just* an introduction, it isn't meant to encompass everything you could possibly want to know about AI... so if you feel it is limited or not quite what you want do, that's expected! In fact, the Costello Fishery example doesn't even give a useful output!

The goal of this repo is to give you a feel for what the process is in designing and building software with AI incorporated. When I say AI, I don't just mean LLMs. While language models are very, very impressive, and super hot right now, they don't encompass the entirety of the landscape of AI. I would only say that using LLMs as a _first_ resort might mean missing out on using a simpler, faster, easier-to-use tool that solves the same problem. Success in AI is about matching problems to solutions well!
